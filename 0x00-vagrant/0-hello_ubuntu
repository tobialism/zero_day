Linux Ubuntu 





The uname command can print more detailed information about the system with different options:

uname -a - print all available system information
uname -r - print kernel release version
uname -v - print kernel version
uname -m - print machine hardware name
uname -p - print processor type
uname -i - print hardware platform
But without any options, it defaults to just printing the kernel name as a simple way to identify the operating system.

So in summary:

uname by itself prints the kernel name
uname -a prints detailed system information
